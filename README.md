# Dont.know.how.to.fold
I am (ms.thang3677 or 03677 or 41980) from etherscan and all othet like platforms.I had plans of learning the pc and joining the crypto/stock.market world last.year. Instead i have spent 8 months, fighting off hackers, with 7 phones, one fire tablet, one ipad, one laptop and a wifi modum all hacked. plus several google accounts. I knew absolutely last year, and somehow made it this far under heavy doss. someone is my constant shadow. They block me from everything (to prevent me from seeing the tons and tons of smart contracts belonging to several google accounts that i have recovered) by invisibly making themselves my work partner admin with program coding. in the begining, i had no idea this was even happening. I had made 8.8 million in profits on cryptomania24 in july. they split. soon after i began noticing odd things. which turned in to 24/7 screen sharing. i need help. i cannot install a terminal. i cannot do anything.
